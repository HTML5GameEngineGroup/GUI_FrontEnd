Updates:

A few test projects (mostly showing individual elements are they are being made)
Several GUI elements (not all) with basic functionality.  A majority of the base is here now and is ready to be connected to the game engine.
Interesting this week: right-click menus via “contextmenu”

Also added a rough paper prototype and organized design guidelines into categories
