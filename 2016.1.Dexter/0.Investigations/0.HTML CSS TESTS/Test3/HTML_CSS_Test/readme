Updates:

Created new panel type with shorter size, also populated at runtime
Used id-based CSS instead of class-based to allow for CSS modification at runtime, but only for a specific element (not yet sure if this will even be used)
Added button click functionality directly (done differently than the other buttons, or it won't work)
Reorganized some of the CSS classes since the "not" class checks were getting out of hand
