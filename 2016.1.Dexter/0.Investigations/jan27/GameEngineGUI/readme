Updates:

Added a temporary component to the Edit Object panel for testing purposes.
Added support for inserting and running scripts.  It's added for update but should be extendable to other key functions.
Added support for script error handling.
    If your script has a bug, it will give you exactly 1 error message and it will NOT crash the page.
    The error message will tell you what was wrong with your script (the console’s standard error message).
    Then it will prevent the script from running but it will let you edit it.
    If you edit it, it will try to run again.
    This will repeat until the user enters a bug-free script.
Added some hard-coded script limitations.  Currently, scripts will not allow the terms: $, document, window.  This blocks some of the ways to tamper with the UI.

Here are some scripts to test:

Display to console
console.log(“hello world”);

Animate something
var xf = this.getXform(); xf.setXPos(xf.getXPos()+0.01);

Error message
console.log(100));
$(document)
