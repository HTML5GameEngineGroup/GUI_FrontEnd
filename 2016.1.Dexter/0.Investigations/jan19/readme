Updates:

Removed redundant reference variables in ObjectContent.  It directly edits the reference object now.
Fixed a bug that allows the ObjectContent wrapper class to add new Content by making EditorPanel create new components when one doesn't exist.
Implemented draggable on GLCanvas, panelEditObject and panelEditCamera.
Implemented resizable GLCanvas with a window.onresize event.  It will always force itself to be 70% of the window width, with a height set based on the original proportions (640x480).  Also, edit panels are 250 pixels wide at all times.
